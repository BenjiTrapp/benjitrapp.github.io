title: Code Obfuscation in Python to cloak scripts
---
 

There are a number of code obfuscation tools for Python that you can use to protect your code from being reverse-engineered by a defender or accessed by EDR/AV.

One popular code obfuscation tool for Python is PyArmor, which provides a range of features and tools for obfuscating, encrypting, and signing your Python code. PyArmor uses a combination of techniques, such as renaming, string encryption, and bytecode manipulation, to make it difficult for users to understand or modify your code. PyArmor also provides a range of features for managing and controlling access to your obfuscated code, such as licensing, activation, and expiration.

Another code obfuscation tool for Python is Pyminifier, which provides a simple, command-line utility for minifying and obfuscating your Python code. Pyminifier uses a variety of techniques, such as removing comments, whitespace, and docstrings, and renaming variables and functions, to make your code more compact and difficult to read. Pyminifier also provides options for excluding specific files or modules from obfuscation, and for generating a compact, standalone version of your code that can be easily distributed or deployed.

Overall, there are a number of code obfuscation tools available for Python that can help you protect your code from being reverse-engineered or accessed by unauthorized users. It is recommended to carefully evaluate the different options and choose the one that best meets the needs of your project.

## PyArmor

Here is an example of how you can use PyArmor to obfuscate a Django application:

First, you need to install PyArmor using pip:

```sh
pip install pyarmor
```

Next, you need to create a PyArmor project for your Django application:

```sh
pyarmor init --src=./myproject --entry=./myproject/manage.py
```

This command creates a pyarmor.json file in the root directory of your project, which contains the configuration settings for PyArmor. You can edit this file to customize the obfuscation options, such as the license key, expiration date, and output directory.

To obfuscate your Django application, you can use the pyarmor obfuscate command:

```sh
pyarmor obfuscate --src=./myproject --output=./dist
```

This command applies the obfuscation transformations to your code, and generates a new, obfuscated version of your Django application in the dist directory. The obfuscated code will be difficult for users to understand or modify, and will be protected by the license and expiration settings you specified in the pyarmor.json file.

You can then distribute the obfuscated code to your users, and they will be able to run your Django application as usual, without being able to access or modify the underlying code.

Overall, this example shows how you can use PyArmor to obfuscate a Django application, and protect your code from being reverse-engineered or accessed by unauthorized users. You can adapt this example to your own requirements by modifying the PyArmor configuration and commands as needed.

## PyInstaller

Yes, you can compile a Django application, along with its dependencies and runtime environment, into a single, standalone binary that can be easily distributed and executed on any system.

To do this, you can use a tool like PyInstaller, which provides a command-line utility for creating standalone executables from Python scripts. PyInstaller uses a number of techniques, such as bytecode transformation, dynamic linking, and code freezing, to create a single, self-contained executable that contains your Django application, its dependencies, and the Python runtime.

Here is an example of how you can use PyInstaller to compile a Django application into a standalone binary:

First, you need to install PyInstaller using pip:

```sh
pip install pyinstaller
```

Next, you need to create a PyInstaller configuration file for your Django application. This configuration file, typically named pyinstaller.spec, defines the options and settings for PyInstaller, such as the entry point, hidden imports, and runtime options. Here is an example pyinstaller.spec file for a Django application:

```py
# -*- mode: python -*-

block_cipher = None


a = Analysis(['manage.py'],
             pathex=['myproject'],
             binaries=[],
             datas=[],
             hiddenimports=['django.core.management'],
             hookspath=[],
             runtime_hooks=[],
             excludes=[],
             win_no_prefer_redirects=False,
             win_private_assemblies=False,
             cipher=block_cipher,
             noarchive=False)
pyz = PYZ(a.pure, a.zipped_data,
          cipher=block_cipher)
exe = EXE(pyz,
          a.scripts,
          a.binaries,
          a.zipfiles,
          a.datas,
          name='myproject',
          debug=False,
          strip=False,
          upx=True,
          runtime_tmpdir=None,
          console=True )
```

This configuration file specifies the entry point of your Django application (manage.py), the path to your project directory (myproject), and the hidden imports (the django.core.management module) that are required by your Django application but not explicitly imported by your code. You can edit this configuration file to customize the options and settings for PyInstaller, as needed.

Once you have created the pyinstaller.spec file, you can use PyInstaller to compile your Django application into a standalone binary:

```sh
pyinstaller pyinstaller.spec
```

This command will generate a standalone binary for your Django application in the dist directory, along with any additional files and directories that are required by your application, such as the Python runtime, library files, and assets.

You can then distribute the standalone binary to your users, and they will be able to run your Django application on their systems, without needing to install Python or any other dependencies.

Overall, this example shows how you can use PyInstaller to compile a Django application, along with its dependencies and runtime environment, into a single, standalone binary. You can adapt this example to your own requirements by modifying the PyInstaller configuration and commands as needed.

### Exclude Tests

If you are using PyInstaller to compile a Python application that contains tests, you can use the excludes option in the PyInstaller configuration file to exclude the tests from being bundled with the standalone executable.

Here is an example of how you can exclude tests from being bundled with PyInstaller:

First, create a pyinstaller.spec file for your application, and specify the excludes option in the Analysis object:

```py
a = Analysis(['manage.py'],
             pathex=['myproject'],
             excludes=['tests'],
             # Other options...
             )
```

This configuration specifies that PyInstaller should exclude the tests directory from the bundle. You can specify multiple paths or patterns in the excludes list, to exclude multiple directories or files from being bundled.

Next, use the pyinstaller command to compile your application:

```sh
pyinstaller pyinstaller.spec
```

This command will generate a standalone binary for your application, without including the tests or any other files or directories that were excluded in the pyinstaller.spec file.

Overall, this example shows how you can use the excludes option in PyInstaller to exclude tests or other files and directories from being bundled with your standalone executable. You can adapt this example to your own requirements by modifying the PyInstaller configuration and commands as needed.
