Greetings, fellow defenders of the digital realm! Today, we're diving into a unique and captivating approach to threat modeling that draws inspiration from the world of the Dark Knight himself - Batman. I'm excited to introduce you with this workshop into the concept of a Batman-themed threat modeling workshop. Just like Batman meticulously plans for every possible threat in Gotham City, I'll guide you through the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks in your projects using a touch of Batman flair.
