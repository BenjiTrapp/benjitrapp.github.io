This command-line tool helps to manage and check IP ranges for various service providers. It allows you to update IP ranges for specific providers, check if an IP belongs to any provider's range, and even verify a list of IPs from a file. Some GitHub Actions are helping to create a nice workflow around the CLI-Tool.

## Features

- **Update IP Ranges:** Keep the IP ranges for various service providers up-to-date with a single command.
- **Check IP:** Determine if a specific IP belongs to the range of any supported provider.
- **Check IPs from File:** Verify a list of IPs from a file and identify the corresponding providers.
