title: Boxed Kali 
---

<img height="200" align="left" src="https://github.com/BenjiTrapp/boxed-kali/raw/main/static/boxedkali.png" > This tool focusses on a dockerized version of Kali that can be accessed over NoVNC in your Browser. The main usage for this way is an additional isolation by the containerization approach. Personally I use this container to perform analysis of potential malicious files and penetration tests within the AWS Cloud and Active Directory.
