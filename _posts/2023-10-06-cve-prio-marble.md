In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, staying ahead of threats is paramount. A critical component of this proactive defense is identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in your system before they can be exploited by malicious actors. The CVE PrioMarble tool emerges as a valuable asset in your arsenal, offering a novel approach to vulnerability prioritization by harnessing the power of CVSS, EPSS, and CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.

## The Power of Prioritization
CVE PrioMarble is addressing the challenge of identifying and managing vulnerabilities effectively. At its core, this tool combines three key elements to provide insights into the likelihood of exploitation and potential impact:

* CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):
  CVSS is a widely recognized standard for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities. It quantifies various aspects of a vulnerability, such as its access complexity and impact, to calculate a score that indicates the level of risk.
* [EPSS](https://www.first.org/epss/data_stats) (Exploit Prediction Scoring System):
  EPSS, developed by the FIRST organization, offers data-driven insights into threat information. EPSS scores help predict the probability of a vulnerability being exploited, allowing for more informed decision-making.
* CISA's [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) Catalog: 
  CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, maintains a catalog of vulnerabilities that have known exploits. These vulnerabilities are especially critical to address promptly.
