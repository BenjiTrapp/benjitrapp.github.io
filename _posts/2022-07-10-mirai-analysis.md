<img height="200" align="left" src="/images/mirai-title.png" > In this slide deck I'll present starting from a timeline a deep dive through the source code of Mirai. Next to highlighting attack methods Mirai also contains some curiosities like Rick Rolling and russian comments. A short discussion is also included regarding the territorial predator capabilities of the botnet next to a glimpse of the psyche of the authors.

Have fun and take the tour through the guts of the Mirai Botnet:
