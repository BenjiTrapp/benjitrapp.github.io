title: Windows ETW (Event Tracing for Windows)
---

<img height="200" align="left" src="/images/etw_defender_logo.png" >
Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) provides a mechanism to trace and log events that are raised by user-mode applications and kernel-mode drivers. ETW is implemented in the Windows operating system and provides developers a fast, reliable, and versatile set of event tracing features. These logs are also forming a crucial baseline for EDR/XDR solutions to detect suspicious or malicious behavior by integration with the operating system.

## Architecture

The following diagram shows how the ETW architecture looks like:

![](/images/etw_architecture.png)

[source of the picture](https://web.archive.org/web/20200725154736/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ntdebugging/part-1-etw-introduction-and-overview)

The overarching concept can be summarized as follows: Consider an application, denoted as "Application A," which executes specific code and necessitates logging of its operations. One approach to accomplish this entails the registration of a "Provider" within ETW. Subsequently, this provider serves as the conduit for disseminating logs to entities interested in accessing them through registration.

To effectively engage with the data provided by this provider, a designated "Consumer" must initiate a "Trace Session." Through this session, all events dispatched by the provider are captured for analysis. The orchestration of these components, including the commencement and termination of sessions, is overseen by a central "Controller."

This systematic framework ensures the coherent management and utilization of logging functionalities within the application environment, fostering a robust defensive posture against cyber threats.

Let's discuss the core components shown in the diagram:

### Controllers

True to their designation, the "Controllers" assume the pivotal role of overseeing all facets concerning ETW. This encompasses tasks ranging from the initiation and cessation of trace sessions to the activation and deactivation of providers within a trace. An exemplary instance of such a controller is the pre-existing utility known as "logman.exe," which will be expounded upon in subsequent discussion and also integrated within some practical scripts.


### Providers

Providers assume the role of generating events and depositing them into the designated ETW sessions. Applications possess the capability to register ETW providers and generate events as per their requirements. Notably, ETW accommodates four distinct types of providers:

* MOF Providers
* WPP Providers
* Manifest-based Providers
* TraceLogging Providers

More details about other types can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/about-event-tracing-) for simplicity I focus on Manifest-based providers from now on. 


In order for a provider to effectively generate events, it necessitates a blueprint or descriptive framework outlining the structure of these events. In the context of "Manifest-Based providers," event descriptions are encapsulated within an "Instrumentation Manifest." This comprehensive document encompasses all pertinent details concerning events, including their structure, filtering mechanisms, values, identifiers, and descriptions. Additional insights regarding this manifest can be found within the resources available on MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network). More details are described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wes/writing-an-instrumentation-manifest)

While parsers exist for these manifests, it is advisable to possess a comprehensive understanding of each field contained within. Primarily, it is imperative to recognize that the "instrumentation manifest" is structured as an XML-based file, indicating that all components within it are XML elements. Consequently, a foundational step involves examining these elements in detail.

##### <provider>

The first element is the "<provider>" element. It’s used to identify a provider and its required. Usually the following attributes are associated with it:

* name — This represents the name of the provider. Its the one that shows when we use a utility like "logman" (That we’ll talk about later)
* guid — This is a globally unique identifier that will identify this provider. Example: {22fb2cd6–0e7b-422b-a0c7–2fad1fd0e716}
* resourceFileName / messageFileName — The path to the executable / DLL that contains the metadata and message resources respectively
* parameterFilePath — The path to the EXE/DLL that contains the strings resources for a provide

What this element actually provide is the identification of the provider and the necessary metadata/strings for tools that want to consume this provider and be able to translate events.

##### <channels>

Channels might be already known to you by the windows utility "Event Viewer" which in the end represent channels

![](/images/etw_channels.webp)

There are four types of channels supported :

* Admin
* Operational
* Analytic
* Debug
* 
The manifest lets us describe if we want a provider to write events to specific channels by using the "channel element" and the following attributes:

* chid — A unique identifier that can be used as a reference in other elements.
* name — A name for the channel. The general guidance is to use the name of the provider followed by an "/" and the type of the channel. Example: "Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational"
* type — Identify the channel type and can be one of the four values described above.

Here is an example adopted from MSDN:
```html
<channel
    chid="c1"
    name="Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational"
    symbol="CHANNEL_DEFENDER_OPERATIONAL"
    type="Operational"
/>
```

##### <levels>

The level element is used to define different log levels and offers the ability to group events based on these levels. The most commonly used levels according to MSDN are the following:


* win:Critical (1)
* win:Error (2)
* win:Warning (3)
* win:Informational (4)
* win:Verbose (5)

![](/images/etw_winmeta.webp)

As depicted in the image above, aside from the predefined levels, there are additional reserved levels ranging from 6 to 15. Providers also possess the capability to define custom levels according to their specific requirements. For instance, the Powershell provider has designated level 20 for debug purposes, as illustrated below:

![](/images/etw_levels.webp)

These levels can be used by consumers as a filtering mechanism to get events with specific levels.

##### <tasks> & <opcodes>

These two elements are used as their name suggests to group events based on tasks and operations. For example, let’s take the "Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process" provider. It defines the following tasks

```xml
...
<task name="ProcessStart" message="ProcessStart" value="1"/>
<task name="ProcessStop" message="ProcessStop" value="2"/>
<task name="ThreadStart" message="ThreadStart" value="3"/>
<task name="ThreadStop" message="ThreadStop" value="4"/>
... 
```

In this example, these are self-explanatory tasks that consumers can use to filter exactly on the type of events they’d like.

Tasks will generally have a name, message, and a value attribute that are self-explanatory.

Similar to tasks, opcodes can be used to describe specific operations. For example, the "Microsoft-Windows-Powershell" provider defines the following opcodes for the task "connect".

```xml
<task name="Connect" message="Connect" value="1">
     <opcodes>
        <opcode name="Open(async)" message="Open(async)" value="10"/>
        <opcode name="tobeusedwhenanobjectisconstructed" message="tobeusedwhenanobjectisconstructed" value="16"/>
        <opcode name="Tobeusedwhenoperationisjustexecutingamethod" message="Tobeusedwhenoperationisjustexecutingamethod" value="20"/>
     </opcodes>
</task>
```
There are some predefined opcodes in the "winmeta.xml" file (Windows SDK) that providers can use and you’ll find some when dumping providers manifests. The list can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wes/eventmanifestschema-opcodetype-complextype)

##### <keywords>

Similar to levels and task elements that we’ve seen previously. The keyword element is also used as a grouping mechanism for consumers to filter on. The keywords element uses the following attributes:

* message —A string describing the keyword
* name —A unique name for the keyword for example "ProcessStart"
* mask — A bit mask that must have only a single bit set
Here is an example from the "Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process" provider:

```xml
...
<keywords>
   <keyword name="WINEVENT_KEYWORD_PROCESS" message="WINEVENT_KEYWORD_PROCESS" mask="0x10"/>
   <keyword name="WINEVENT_KEYWORD_THREAD" message="WINEVENT_KEYWORD_THREAD" mask="0x20"/>
   <keyword name="WINEVENT_KEYWORD_IMAGE" message="WINEVENT_KEYWORD_IMAGE" mask="0x40"/>
   <keyword name="WINEVENT_KEYWORD_CPU_PRIORITY" message="WINEVENT_KEYWORD_CPU_PRIORITY" mask="0x80"/>
</keywords>
...
```

##### <maps>

Another interesting element that can help consumers and us when reading manifests is the maps element. This element simply defines a relationship between a value and a string. These maps will be used as a translation mechanism when parsing events data. For example, an event could return a field with certain values and when we try to parse these values we find that they are mapped to specific strings as we can see in the "Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client" provider:

```xml
<maps>
<valueMap name="DnsIpTypeMap">
<map value="0x0" message="static"/>
<map value="0x1" message="dynamic"/>
</valueMap>
</maps>
```
##### <templates>

Sometimes when events are generated their messages are self-contained, meaning that no extra data is required to describe the event. But when an event contains specific data we need to define a template describing the fields we’re adding.

Let’s illustrate this with an example. So we have some action that will generate an event and this event will contain some dynamic data that needs to be mapped as such:

```js
Message : Correlating activity id's. %n %t CurrentActivityId: %1 %n %t ParentActivityId: %2
```

Now once a consumer sees this it needs to replace the values of "%1" and "%2" with the appropriate data. For this a template is defined as such :

```xml
<template tid="T_CorrelationEvent">
<data inType="win:GUID" name="currentActivityId" />
<data inType="win:GUID" name="parentActivityId" />
</template>
```

From this we can conclude that:

* "%1" represents the "currentActivityId"
* "%2" represents the "parentActivityId"
Template attributes contain information about the type of the data and if it’s mapped for example to a "maps" element.

##### <event>

Similar to when writing a program one has to declare variables, define functions and classes. All of the elements seen above can be thought of as such. Now that we’ve defined how things are organized its time to define the events themselves.

For every event, a program that wants to write/capture an "<event>" XML element must be defined. This element must have an identifier or value that is unique as this value is what we often refer to as EVENT ID or EID.

Let’s take an example from the "Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process" provider:

```xml
<event value="1" symbol="ProcessStart" version="0" task="ProcessStart" opcode="win:Start" level="win:Informational" keywords=
"WINEVENT_KEYWORD_PROCESS" template="ProcessStartArgs"/>
```


As observed, this snippet includes the essential attribute "value," configured with a setting of "1." Consequently, to capture this particular event, one could conduct a search for instances with the value "Event Id=1." Additionally, numerous other attributes are present, which ideally should be familiar to us by now. These attributes, such as "task," "opcode," "level," and "template," among others, correspond to previously defined elements. They serve as integral components of the filtering mechanism tailored to cater to the needs of consumers.

##### <localization>

The last aspect we'll discuss is "localization," a concept that is relatively straightforward. While I have personally handled the substitution in the aforementioned examples, in practice, any of the aforementioned elements will typically feature a definition similar to this one.

```xml
<task name="ProcessStart" message="$(string.task_ProcessStart)" value="1"/>
```

In this scenario, the variable "message" holds a reference to a specific entity, which corresponds to the strings encapsulated within the "localization" element. Allow me to illustrate this with an example:

```xml
<localization>
<resources culture="en-GB">
<stringTable>
<string id="keyword_WINEVENT_KEYWORD_PROCESS" value="WINEVENT_KEYWORD_PROCESS"/>
<string id="keyword_WINEVENT_KEYWORD_THREAD" value="WINEVENT_KEYWORD_THREAD"/>
<string id="keyword_WINEVENT_KEYWORD_IMAGE" value="WINEVENT_KEYWORD_IMAGE"/>
...
</stringTable>
</resources>
</localization>
```

It's a straightforward concept to understand.

To get a better understanding of this I suggest you walk through an example using a provider manifest. 

### Trace Sessions / Trace Files (.etl)

Trace sessions function as a mechanism facilitating the subscription to a defined set of providers, accompanied by various configurations. These configurations encompass options such as determining whether the sessions operate in real-time or involve writing to trace files (.etl), among others.

Trace sessions have the ability to enable providers using two types of keyword bitmasks that we’ll see often:

* Keyword (Any): enables you to specify an 8-byte, hexadecimal bitmask value that represents one or more Keywords — MSDN
* Keyword (All): an optional 8-byte, hexadecimal bitmask that further restricts the category of events that an ETW event provider writes — MSDN
Let’s illustrate these two concepts with an example adapted from MSDN.


Let's consider the following three-bit keywords:

* READ: 001
* LOCAL Events: 010
* REMOTE Events: 100

Now, suppose we have two events:

* Event 1 -> Utilizes "READ + LOCAL" keywords (011)
* Event 2 -> Utilizes "READ + REMOTE" keywords (101)

The "Keyword (Any)" parameter enables us to specify the bits we wish to filter on. If any of the event bitmasks match our filter, a hit is obtained.

For instance, to retrieve events related to reading, we could set "Keywords (Any)" to "001" and receive any events with this bit set in their value. For more specificity, setting "Keywords (All)" to "101" would exclusively capture Event 2, while setting it to "011" would solely capture Event 1.

Essentially, the "Any" filter allows us to match with events possessing at least matching bits, whereas the "All" filter mandates that all bits match to capture the event. This distinction proves valuable when querying trace sessions to comprehend their configuration and determine the events captured versus those excluded.

### Consumers

The final component within the ETW architecture to be discussed is consumers. These are applications or programs designed to read or listen to Trace Files or Sessions. One notable consumer is the Event Viewer.


## Interacting with ETW

Next to Powershell commands the easiest way is using the built-in tool "logman.exe" that acts in the roll of a controller.

We have discussed providers and trace sessions above. It's important to note that Windows comes pre-installed with over 1000 registered providers and at least a dozen trace sessions. We can retrieve a comprehensive list of these using the logman utility.

#### Use logman.exe to query providers
> Requires NO Administrator privileges

As oneliner:
```powershell
logman.exe query providers
```

A more mature script for running into .ps1:
```powershell
$result = . "c:\Windows\System32\logman.exe" query providers
$list = New-Object "System.Collections.Generic.List[string]";
$list.Add("|Provider | GUID |")
$list.Add("|---- | ---- |")
$result `
| where {$_} `
| select -Skip 2 `
| %{
    $data = $_ -split "{";
    $list.Add("|" + $data[0].TrimEnd() + "|" + "{" + $data[1] + "|");
}
$list.RemoveAt($list.Count -1)
$list
```

This looks like this example if you run the oneliner
```
# logman.exe query providers
[Provider]               [GUID]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
...
Microsoft-Windows-Crypto-CNG  {E3E0E2F0-C9C5-11E0-8AB9-9EBC4824019B}

```powershell
logman.exe query providers "<ADD PROVIDER NAME HERE>"
```

## Extracting ETW Providers


We have explored various examples demonstrating interaction with ETW. However, there are instances when we simply require the provider manifest in a tangible form, as a single file, rather than accessing properties of the object. Fortunately, there are several methods available for extracting these manifests, including tools like ETW Explorer and PerfView.

#### ETW Explorer / Perfview

"ETW Explorer" and "Perfview" actually use the same API under the hood to extract the provider manifest.

```
RegisteredTraceEventParser.GetManifestForRegisteredProvider
```

ETW Explorer can be downloaded and used directly from [here](https://github.com/zodiacon/EtwExplorer). The tool itself is kind of self-explanatory. Some ideas and impressions are shown below:
