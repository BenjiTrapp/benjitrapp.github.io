Journey and quick overview related to SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) to highlight why it matters related to supply chain attacks. 

> Big overview related to SBOM by [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom#:~:text=A%20%E2%80%9Csoftware%20bill%20of%20materials,that%20make%20up%20software%20components.)

## Why SBOMs matter

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a detailed inventory of all the software components used in a particular product or application, including
the dependencies between them. It is increasingly being recognized as an essential component of software development and supply chain
management.

Here are some reasons why SBOMs are important:
1. Preventing supply chain attacks: SBOMs can help prevent supply chain attacks by allowing to track and manage software components
more effectively. With an SBOM, identification of vulnerabilities in their software supply chain and take steps to mitigate them. For
example, if a particular software component has a known vulnerability, you could quickly identify all the products that use that component and take action to patch or replace it (remember Log4Shell?)
2. Enhancing transparency: SBOMs can enhance transparency in the software supply chain. By providing a detailed inventory of all the
software components used in a particular product or application, SBOMs can help to ensure that they are using only authorized software
components and reduce the risk of using unapproved, wrong licenses, or potentially malicious components.
3. Improving maturity with open source dependencies: Open source software is now an essential part of software development, and
managing open source dependencies is critical to building secure and reliable software. With an SBOM, identify and track open source
dependencies is more effectively, making it easier to manage licenses and vulnerabilities associated with those dependencies.
4. Meeting compliance requirements: Many industries and governments have compliance requirements for software development and
supply chain management like in the US and similar cases are expected for the EU. SBOMs can help to meet these requirements by
providing a detailed inventory of all the software components used in a particular product or application.

In summary, SBOMs are essential in preventing supply chain attacks, enhancing transparency in the software supply chain, improving
maturity with open source dependencies, and meeting compliance requirements. By providing a detailed inventory of software components
and their dependencies, organizations can make more informed decisions about software development and supply chain management,
ultimately leading to more secure and reliable software.

## SBOM CLI
Within Docker, there is a dedicated CLI command for creating an SBOM based on a specific image. In short, the docker sbom <image>
command pulls the image and parses it to collect all types of dependencies that are built into the image.

The CLI command helps retrieve the dependency details, version, and type, and also covers Python PyPi packages, for example. The
SBOM can then be used to feed a dependency checking tool or a scanner to get insight into possible bugs in the image.

In action it looks like this:

The build in command uses [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) to create the SBOM of an arbitrary image. 


A SBOM alone is just a first step towards security and an improved container security. 

To scan for vulnerabilities you have multiple options:

*  Use either [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)  which can be seen as the security addition of Syft
*  [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) which can be seen as a combination of Syft and Grype. 
*  [bomber](https://github.com/devops-kung-fu/bomber) as a scanner based on the generated SBOM
