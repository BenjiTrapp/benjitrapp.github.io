## Considerations
- Service/software inventory: which ports are used? is software up to date? is it securely configured?
- Network and local user inventory: are network accounts being used across multiple assets? 
- System inventory: are new systems appearing? are current systems reachable?

## Powershell/Windows Shell

### List Firewall Rules
#### Get all rules beginning with a string
`Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup Remote*` 

#### Get all inbound rules beginning with a string
`Get-NetFirewallRule -Action Allow -Enabled False -Direction Inbound -DisplayGroup Network* | select DisplayName, DisplayGroup`

### User Account Administration
#### Change AD user account password:
`Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity <sAMAccountName> -Reset -NewPassword <password>`

#### Change local user account password:
`net user <username> <newpass>`

### Active Directory
#### Create GPO report:

```powershell
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
Import-Module GroupPolicy
```

##### identify the DC
```powershell
$dc = Get-ADDomainController -Discover -Service PrimaryDC
```

##### use this to generate HTML report for single GPO
```powershell
Get-GPOReport -Name "A Group Policy Object" -Domain awesome.lab -Server $dc -ReportType HTML -Path C:\Users\Person\Desktop\GPOreport.html
```

##### use this to generate HTML report for all GPOs in the domain
```powershell
Get-GPOReport -All -Domain awesome.lab -Server $dc -ReportType HTML -Path C:\Users\Person\Desktop\AllGPOreport.html
Event Logs
Display local event logs
eventquery.vbs | more
eventquery.vbs /L Security | more
```

##### Search for a specific event ID
```powershell
wevtutil qe security /q:”*[System[(EventID=1102)]]” /c:5 /f:text /rd:true
```

/q: Specifies the query. The only thing you really need to change in here is the EventID, just replace it for the one you want. You can use truth operators in here as well as query specific alert levels.
/c: specifies the number of events to display. (If you place nothing here, it will find all matching events)
/f: Specifies the output type, by default it uses XML which can be difficult to read.
/rd: This takes True or False. Set this to true in order to see the newest logs first.

Services, Processes, and Ports
List running processes and output to file
tasklist > c:\processes.txt

wmic query examples from stack overflow
bash

##### Name and account for all services
```powershell
wmic service get name,startname
```

##### started services only
```powershell
wmic service where started=true get  name, startname
```

##### services with specific pattern in name:
```powershell
wmic service where 'name like "%sql%"' get  name, startname
```

##### nicely formatted as html table (and then opened in your browser):
```powershell
(wmic service where 'name like "%sql%"' get  name, startname /format:htable >out.html) && out.html
```

##### Full syntax [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394531%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
```powershell
List listening ports/connections, PIDs, files responsible
netstat -anob
```

Resource monitor
resmon.exe - the above plus process names and firewall rule status for the service/application

File Integrity
Computes the cryptographic hash of a given file. Algorithms are: MD2 MD4 MD5 SHA1 SHA256 SHA384 SHA512.
certutil -hashfile C:\path\to\file SHA256

Nix Handy Stuff
```powershell
netstat -tunapl - listening ports and processes
ps auxf - process tree view
cat /etc/passwd - list users
```
